# swe-backupssh
Backup mod for Smoothwall Express employing SSH.

Reference:  http://community.smoothwall.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=276799#p276799

This is a modified port from the above (referenced) mod to the modernized SWE 3.x mod architecture.  I believe I have
also simplified many of the installation and modification scripts, while maintaining the same core functionality.  Aesthetics
are for others to judge.

Once I'm done with it'll work for me.  If there's enough interest/motivation, maybe I'll make tweaks so it works for others, 
as well.  Feature requests TBD.
